//this isn't working :(

get just the room number.
the room number should only be the first three digits of the room number column value.  

any room number of the following is a private room: [ 
104, 108, 202, 206, 208, 214, 302, 308, 314,
315, 325, 335, 340, 345, 350, 360, 365, 375,
380, 385, 390, 415, 425, 435, 440, 450, 460,
465, 475, 480, 485, 490 ] 
any other room number is a dorm room.


create a report that sorts each room number in 5 groups based off the room number.

group 0 has room numbers [102, 104, 106, 108, 110]
group 1 has room numbers [202, 204, 206, 208, 210, 212, 214, 216]
group 2 has room numbers [302, 304, 306, 308, 310, 312, 314, 316]
group 3 has room numbers [215, 220, 225, 230, 235, 240, 245, 250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 280, 285, 290, 295]
group 4 has room numbers [315, 320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345, 350, 355, 360, 365, 370, 375, 380, 385, 390, 395]
group 5 has room numbers [415, 420, 425, 430, 435, 440, 445, 450, 455, 460, 465, 470, 475, 480, 485, 490, 495]

tally up any duplicate room numbers. 
tallied room numbers should be formated in the report as `[room num] - [num of instances]`

Report should be formatted like the following:
```
🛏️ Today's Arrivals By Room 🛏️

* - Is A Private Room

[Group 0 room numbers]

[Group 1 room numbers]

[Group 2 room numbers]

[Group 3 room numbers]

[Group 4 room numbers]
